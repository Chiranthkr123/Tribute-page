          <p>
           Shivakumara Swami <br>(born Shivanna; 1 April 1907 – 21 January 2019)[5] was an Indian humanitarian, spiritual leader, educator and supercentenarian. He was a Lingayatism religious figure. Swami joined the Siddaganga Matha in 1930 Karnataka and became head seer in 1941.[6] He also founded the Sri Siddaganga Education Society.[7] Described as the most esteemed adherent of Lingayatism (Veerashaivism),[8] he was referred to as Nadedaaduva Devaru (walking God) in the state.[2] In 2015, Swami was awarded by the Government of India the Padma Bhushan, India's third highest civilian award.[2]
